[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rpcvjet/API-ChurchApp.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rpcvjet/API-ChurchApp)


### This is the Api for my Mothers ChurchApp

This is a Node.js API with a Postgres database. 

If you want to check this out, you'll have to create an **.env** file with:
`PORT=NUMBER`
`APP_SECRET=mysecretpassword`

Otherwise, just type `npm i` to get all the dependencies and then `node server.js`.
